TableX makes it easier for you to stay up-to-date with the latest version by the built-in updater.

On startup, the updater will check if there are any new updates available and will prompt you to install it or not.

:::note
TableX will _**not**_ automatically install updates for you, it will _**only**_
check if there is a new update or not and if so it will ask you if you would like to download and install it or not.

You can disable the automatic checking by changing the [checkForUpdates](/references/settings#checkforupdates) setting.
