TableX ships with a little CLI that you can use to hook into your database from your terminal.

Refer to the [CLI reference]() for a list of all arguments/flags available.

:::note
TableX doesn't get added to your `PATH` by default, you need to add it first
before you can use the CLI, See below.
:::

## Setup

<Steps>

1.  Add TableX to your path.

        **Windows**:
        ```sh
        set PATH="%PATH%;C:\path\to\tablex"
        ```
        If you wish to add it to your path _permanently_, [follow this guide](https://windowsloop.com/how-to-add-to-windows-path/)

        **MacOS** & **Linux**:
        ```sh
        export PATH = "$PATH :/path/to/tablex"
        ```
        You can also add the above line to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` to add it permanently.

2.  Test it.

    ```sh
    tablex --help
    ```

</Steps>
