TableX gives you the ability to modify it's settings to control how it behaves in certain situations.

Similar to VSCode's, your settings will be stored under your `config_dir` directory:

- `Windows`: `C:\Users\${USERNAME}\AppData\Roaming\tablex\settings.json`
- `MacOS`: <Badge text="TODO" variant="tip" size="small" />
- `Linux`: <Badge text="TODO" variant="tip" size="small" />

You can find all the available options in the [settings configuration reference](/references/settings).

## Modifying settings

### In Default Editor

Open the command palette ( `Ctrl + p` ), scroll down to the
bottom and there you will find an `Open settings.json` option.

This will open the settings file in your default editor and you can change the fields as you desire.

:::note
A refresh ( `Ctrl + r` ) is required in order for the changes to take effect.
This will be improved in future versions.

### From the GUI

If you prefer a nicer interface to interact with your settings, you can open the
command palette ( `Ctrl + p` ), open `preferences`, and navigate to the `settings` tab on the left-hand side.

:::tip
On the bottom-right corner, you will find a button that opens the settings in your default editor.
