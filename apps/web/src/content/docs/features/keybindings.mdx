A keyboard is a vital piece in every programmers workflow, that's why TableX tries to be as keyboard ergonomic as possible, offering you a configurable keybindings system inspired by VSCode's.

Side-by-side with your settings configuration, `keybindings.json` will be stored in your `config_dir`:

- `Windows`: `C:\Users\${USERNAME}\AppData\Roaming\tablex\keybindings.json`
- `MacOS`: <Badge text="TODO" variant="tip" size="small" />
- `Linux`: <Badge text="TODO" variant="tip" size="small" />

You can find all the available commands in the [keybindings commands reference](/references/keybindings).

## Modifying keybindings

### In Default Editor

Open the command palette ( `Ctrl + p` ), scroll down to the
bottom and there you will find an `Open keybindings.json` option.

This will open the keybindings file in your default editor and you can change the fields as you desire.

:::tip
No need to refresh the app as your new modified keybindings will take effect immediately after you save

### From the GUI

If you prefer a nicer interface to interact with your settings, you can open the
command palette ( `Ctrl + p` ), open `preferences`, and navigate to the `settings` tab on the left-hand side.

:::tip
On the bottom-right corner, you will find a button that opens the settings in your default editor.
